1000 reserveringen ophalen, niet 10

stuur offerte (maak pagina, stuur mail met pdf..)
acties advies 'staat al 2 dagen op status sent.., you should call or you haven't heard from this client in 1 month, maybe call them for an update? 'ignore'..)

on load, get new reservations and update info and res_status from s2m into db.
then set all reservations without 'success or failed' from yesterday or earlier to status_sales = success, all cancellations would be failures.
this is done for analytic purposes later.

make the view user based. all filters, all actions. all reservations belong to an organisation, but show who's edited last, and make sure 2 people can't work on the same res.




-------wannahaves
show 'revisions' to see who sent that offer...
grove stats 'annuleringsratio, omzet vs budget, etc...'.
filters logischer weergeven

-------just an idea
#save bootstrap and run from local in stead of web? not sure, only if speed needs improvements...
filteren op groepsgroottes?
